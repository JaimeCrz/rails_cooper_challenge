# [Welcome to Cooper API](https://cooper-api-challenge.herokuapp.com/)


### Short paragraph

This project was made in mind of the Cooper test Explanation here below.

The 12-minute run fitness test was developed by Kenneth Cooper, M.D., in 19681 as an easy way to measure aerobic fitness and provide an estimate of VO2 max for military personnel. The Cooper test, as it's also known, is still used today as a field test for determining aerobic fitness.
